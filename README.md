# PitchTracker
An Android project for college. Acts as a pitch tracker and saves a sequence of notes thus identified. Displays them in timeline form with their location on a guitar fretboard. Also works as a tuner. 

I have been having issues with launching threads in some other phones, but it works fine on mine.
